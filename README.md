# Development

## Usage Instructions
<!-- To utilize the application, the user would access the application via [React](https://tranquil-lake-26395.herokuapp.com/) link.
<br>
Ideally, the user would view burgers that are on the list but not yet eaten. With an Eaten Already button, that would mark the burgers as Devoured and move them to the other list. There is also a Delete button, which would remove the item from the table/list of burgers.
<br>
When adding another burger, the user would be able to choose the burger name and whether they have been eaten yet or not.
